// Client-side auto-retry for chat requests, covering two failure classes:
//
// 1. Transport-level failures: fetch rejects before any response arrives,
//    surfaced by browsers as a TypeError (e.g. "Failed to fetch" / "Load
//    failed" / "NetworkError" — exact wording varies by browser and there's
//    no reliable way to distinguish transient from permanent ones).
// 2. Retryable HTTP responses: the request completed but the server
//    signalled a transient failure it is safe to re-send, optionally overridden
//    by an `x-should-retry` response header and/or a server-requested delay
//    (`retry-after-ms` or `Retry-After`). Policy ported from pi's
//    provider-retry (earendil-works/pi, MIT).
//
// INVARIANT: a retry decision is only ever made from a response that has
// not started streaming to the caller yet — this function either returns a
// Response immediately (success, or a non-retryable/exhausted failure) or
// loops internally to fetch again; it never restarts a response body the
// caller has begun reading. A 200 is always returned on the first
// successful fetch and never re-fetched — re-running a chat turn after
// tokens/tool-calls have started streaming would re-execute tool calls
// against the scene graph. A non-2xx body we've decided to retry is
// explicitly cancelled (`response.body?.cancel()`) before retrying so the
// connection isn't leaked.
