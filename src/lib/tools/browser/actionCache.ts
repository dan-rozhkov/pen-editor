/**
 * Local action cache for browse_task's step loop (Stagehand-style: replay a
 * known action against the current page with zero inference, self-heal by
 * deleting the entry the moment a replay turns out wrong): skip a paid
 * /api/browse/step (Jev) call when the same goal has already been solved,
 * at this exact point in the flow (same page identity + same element set +
 * same history + same scroll position), on this exact page before.
 *
 * (browse_act's separate `element` natural-language-targeting cache was
 * removed — a code review found it duplicated most of this module's
 * machinery for a much lower-value, harder-to-verify-safe path; `element`
 * now always resolves through /api/browse/locate.)
 *
 * EXACT-INPUT MEMO, not a fuzzy lookup: a code review found a previous
 * normalized/truncated key unsafe (a stale entry could keep matching a page
 * whose element set or history had actually moved on, since the key ignored
 * both), and a live bench found it almost never hit anyway (goal wording
 * varies enough that lowercasing/URL-stripping alone rarely produced a
 * repeat key). Trying to fuzzy-match text that varies unpredictably is a
 * losing trade: it buys a few extra hits at the cost of occasionally
 * replaying the WRONG action against a page that only superficially
 * resembles the one the entry was learned on. This cache instead only ever
 * hits on a byte-identical replay of the same goal against the same page at
 * the same point in the flow — a narrower but SAFE cache, which is the
 * point: see `buildStepCacheKey` below for exactly what "identical" means.
 *
 * The *value* is never the answer itself — it's a {labelHash, tag, role?}
 * fingerprint of the element that worked, re-resolved against a FRESH
 * snapshot every time by requiring an exact, UNIQUE labelHash+tag(+role)
 * match (`resolveCachedIndex`). That's what makes a stale entry self-heal
 * instead of silently misfiring: an ambiguous or absent match is treated as
 * a cache miss, and an entry whose replay actually runs but fails (rejected,
 * or landed no effect) is deleted by the caller before falling back to the
 * normal Jev path. Typed text is never stored verbatim either — see
 * `CachedStep.textRange`'s doc comment — and neither is the element's own
 * label: only its hash is kept (see "no raw text persisted" below).
 *
 * COLLISION SAFETY: `buildStepCacheKey` combines TWO independently-seeded
 * FNV-1a hashes (the canonical key string, and the same string reversed —
 * see `secondHash`) into one 64-bit-ish key, which makes an accidental key
 * collision between two genuinely different contexts astronomically
 * unlikely but not literally impossible for a 32-bit-per-hash scheme run
 * over enough entries. Belt-and-suspenders: every entry also stores a
 * `verify` block — hashes of the goal and of the element-set fingerprint,
 * computed with the SECOND seed only (so a `key` collision, which already
 * required both hashes to collide, would additionally need both `verify`
 * hashes to collide too) — and `lookupStepCache` recomputes and compares
 * both against the CURRENT goal/elements before returning a hit; either
 * mismatching is treated as a miss and the entry is deleted rather than
 * risked. Collisions here are self-healing, not "guaranteed" impossible —
 * the verify check is what makes a false hit non-catastrophic, not a claim
 * that hashing can't collide.
 *
 * Storage: a single localStorage blob (key `pen.browseActionCache.v1`),
 * capped at MAX_ENTRIES total entries (LRU eviction by `lastUsed`) and
 * TTL_MS old. Every access is wrapped in try/catch and degrades to a no-op
 * — private browsing, a quota error, `localStorage` missing entirely (SSR/
 * non-browser test environments) all just mean "no cache today", never a
 * thrown error. Kill switch: `localStorage.pen.browseActionCache = "off"`.
