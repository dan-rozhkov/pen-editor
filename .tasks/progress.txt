2026-02-13: stroke-align — Added strokeAlign property (inside/center/outside) to BaseNode.
  - UI: SelectInput on same row as Mode in StrokeSection
  - Konva: sceneFunc with clip/evenodd for inside/outside on rect, frame, ellipse, polygon, path
  - PixiJS: native alignment parameter (0/0.5/1) for unified strokes; per-side offset for per-side strokes
  - Tested in browser: UI renders, center/inside alignment visually verified on rect
